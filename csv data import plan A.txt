need to change the my.ini file in C:\ProgramData\MySQL\MySQL Server 8.0

I first tried to alter the file in notepad but it didnt let me run as admin. 
so open Wordpad and open my.ini from wordpad.
Then scroll to the very end and tpye:

local_infile=1
secure_file_priv=''

THen you etiehr restart the mySQL server or simpler is to restart the whole computer,

Then run 

SHOW VARIABLES LIKE "local_infile";

again
